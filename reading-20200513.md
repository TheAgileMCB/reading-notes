# Collections
.Net provides a number of common *collections* to help users organize data. Different collections types are designed for different purposes. The in-built collections of *collection classes* are as follows:

- System.Collections.Generic
- System.Collections.Concurrent
- System.Collections

## System.Collections.Generic Classes
A *generic collection* is useful when every item in the collection has the same data type. Generic collections enforce strong typing. Frequently accessed classes include the following:

- Dictionary<TKey,TValue> - Represents a collection of key/value pairs that are organized based on the key.
- List<T> - Represents a list of objects that can be accessed by index. Provides methods to search, sort, and modify lists.
- Queue<T> - Represents a first in, first out (FIFO) collection of objects.
- SortedList<TKey,TValue> - Represents a collection of key/value pairs that are sorted by key based on the associated IComparer<T> implementation.
- Stack<T> - Represents a last in, first out (LIFO) collection of objects.

Below is an example of a **Simple Collection**:

```
// Create a list of strings.
var salmons = new List<string>();
salmons.Add("chinook");
salmons.Add("coho");
salmons.Add("pink");
salmons.Add("sockeye");

// Iterate through the list.
foreach (var salmon in salmons)
{
    Console.Write(salmon + " ");
}
// Output: chinook coho pink sockeye
```

## System.Collections.Concurrent Classes
*Concurrent classes* provide efficient thread-safe operations for accessing collection items from multiple threads. This type should be used whenever multiple threads are accessing the collection concurrently. 

## System.Collections Classes
Classes in the *System.Collections* namespace do not store elements as specifically typed objects, but as objects of type *Object*. For this reason, it is recommended to use classes from System.Collections.Generic or System.Collections.Concurrent instead of the *legacy types* of System.Collections. Frequently used classes are as follows:

- ArrayList - Represents an array of objects whose size is dynamically increased as required.
- Hashtable - Represents a collection of key/value pairs that are organized based on the hash code of the key.
- Queue - Represents a first in, first out (FIFO) collection of objects.
- Stack - Represents a last in, first out (LIFO) collection of objects.

## LINQ
**LINQ (Language-Integrated Query)** can be used to access collections. These queries are capable of providing  filtering, ordering, and grouping capabilities. The following is an example of a LINQ query provided by [Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/collections):

```
private static void ShowLINQ()
{
    List<Element> elements = BuildList();

    // LINQ Query.
    var subset = from theElement in elements
                 where theElement.AtomicNumber < 22
                 orderby theElement.Name
                 select theElement;

    foreach (Element theElement in subset)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(theElement.Name + " " + theElement.AtomicNumber);
    }

    // Output:
    //  Calcium 20
    //  Potassium 19
    //  Scandium 21
}

private static List<Element> BuildList()
{
    return new List<Element>
    {
        { new Element() { Symbol="K", Name="Potassium", AtomicNumber=19}},
        { new Element() { Symbol="Ca", Name="Calcium", AtomicNumber=20}},
        { new Element() { Symbol="Sc", Name="Scandium", AtomicNumber=21}},
        { new Element() { Symbol="Ti", Name="Titanium", AtomicNumber=22}}
    };
}

public class Element
{
    public string Symbol { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int AtomicNumber { get; set; }
}
```

## Enumeration Types
An *enumeration type* is a value type defined by a set of named constants integers. To define an enumeration type, use the *enum* keyword and specify the names of the *enum members* like so:

```
enum Season
{
    Spring,
    Summer,
    Autumn,
    Winter
}
```

You **cannot** define a method within the definition of an enumeration type. To add functionality, you must create an *extension method*.

An *extension method* enables you to "add" methods to existing types without creating new derived types, compiling, or modifying the original type. **Extension methods are static, but they're called as if they were instance methods on the extended type.** 

## Iterators
*Iterators* are used to perform custom iterations over a collection. An iterator can be a method or a *get* accessor. An iterator uses a **yield return statement** to return each element of the collection one at a time.

A **yield return statement** removes the need for an explicit extra class to hold the state for an enumeration when you implement the *IEnumerable* and *IEnumerator* patterns for a custom collection type. It is implemented simply as such:

```
yield return <expression>;
yield break;
```

You call an iterator by using a *Foreach statement*. Each iteration of the loop calls the iterator. When a *yield return statement* is reached within the iterator, the loop breaks and an expression is returned. The current location in code is remembered, and **execution is restarted from that location the enxt time the iterator is called.** An example follows:

```
private static void ListEvenNumbers()
{
    foreach (int number in EvenSequence(5, 18))
    {
        Console.Write(number.ToString() + " ");
    }
    Console.WriteLine();
    // Output: 6 8 10 12 14 16 18
}

private static IEnumerable<int> EvenSequence(
    int firstNumber, int lastNumber)
{
    // Yield even numbers in the range.
    for (var number = firstNumber; number <= lastNumber; number++)
    {
        if (number % 2 == 0)
        {
            yield return number;
        }
    }
}
```
