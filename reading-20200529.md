# OpenAPI
APIs can be complex and hard to understand at times. *OpenAPI* (or Swagger) arrives to save the day! OpenAPI addresses these hardships providing things like interactive API documentation, client SDK generation, and API discoverability.
 
The centerpiece of the OpenAPI *flow* is the OpenAPI Specification (OAS). This is a document called *swagger.json* that is automatically generated by the OpenAPI tool chain or some third party version of it. This document looks like an API return, itself, and describes the capabilities of an API and how to access it with HTTP.
 
Swagger.io describes it as follows:
> The OAS defines a standard, language-agnostic interface to RESTful APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service without access to source code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection. When properly defined, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic.
 
> An OpenAPI definition can then be used by documentation generation tools to display the API, code generation tools to generate servers and clients in various programming languages, testing tools, and many other use cases.
 
Below is an example of a *swagger.json* file:
 
```

## OpenAPI User Interface
OpenAPI's UI is web-based. It provides information about the service using the .json document it generated from the API in question. Services called *Swashbuckle* and *NSwag* include embedded versions on this UI so that it can be hosted within an ASP.NET Core application using middleware. Public action methods like GET, PUT, and POST can even be tested from within the UI!
