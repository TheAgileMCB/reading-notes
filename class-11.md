# Googly Analytics

**Google Analytics** is a free analytics tool provided by Google. (Duh, right?) But what does that really mean?

Google Analytics works by recording date about how users interact with web sites, then presents it to clients in the form of in-depth tables, charts, and graphs. Analytics tracks *everything*--how many people visit your page, how many of those users are or aren't repeat viewers; which pages they look at on your site, how many times, and for how long; on what page they enter your site, and on what page they decide to leave; if they purchase anything in your online store, what they purchase, and how much; and more!

Most of the web is using analytics tools these days (66% of those instances are using Google Analytics), and those who aren't are sorely missing out on marketable opportunities to improve their user experience and conversion rate.

Analytics will even track other sites that link to your page and the traffic generated by those links. This could help you make valuable partnerships on the web by opening you to opportunities for collaboration. And tools to collect and display search terms used to access your site can help you decide how to better establish yourself for **Search Engine Optimization (SEO)** and to adapt to what customers actually want from their time on your site.

Google's graphs and tracking go deeper. You can analyze trends and search for specific time periods. Do you really *need* a mobile site? You can see information on if users are finding you on mobile or desktop more. You can create marketing campaigns with specific tags and then track the conversion rates on those opportunities, as well.

All-in-all, analytics tools are an increasingly diverse and useful array of opportunities for you and users to better connect and better access what they're looking for and what you're offering. Make use of these tools as you build, design, and improve the user experience of your web sites!
