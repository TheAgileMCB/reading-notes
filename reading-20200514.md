# LINQ
*LINQ Queries* are a game changer in dataset management. A *query* is an expression that retrieves data from a data source. Previously, different languages have been developed for different data sources, for example SQL for relational databases and XQuery for XML. So, developers have had to learn a new query language any time they wanted to work with a new data source. Enter: LINQ.

LINQ offeres a consistent model for working with data from many different data sources and in different formats! LINQ queries **always** work with *objects*. You use the same structured code to query and transform data in XML documents, SQL databases, ADO.NET Datasets, .NET collections, and any other data format for which a LINQ provider is available.

## The Query Operation
All LINQ query operations have 3 parts:
- obtain the data source
- create a query
- execute the query

### The Data Source
A *queryable type* requires no modification or special treatment to serve as a LINQ data source. If, however, the source data is not already in memory asa queryable type, the LINQ provider must represent it as such. As an example, LINQ to XML loads XML documetns into queryable XElement types.

A query is executed using a *foreach statement*. Foreach statements require *IEnumerable* or *IEnumberable<T>* types. Types that support *IEnumerable<T>* or a derived interface such as the generic *IQueryable<T>* are examples of queryable types.

### The Query
The query specifies what information to retrieve from the data sources. A query also specifies how that information should be sorted, grouped and shaped before it is returned. The query is stored in a variable and initialized with a query expression. **C# has introduced a new query syntax for ease of execution.**

Query expressions contain 3 clauses: *from*, *where*, and *select*. (**NOTE: The ordering of these clauses is *reversed* from the order of an SQL query**). *From* specifies the data source. *Where* applies a filter. *Select* specifies the type of the returned elements.

For more details, read: [LINQ(Language Integrated Query)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/linq/).

**Note: The query variable takes no action and returns no data. It simply stores the data until the query is executed.**

### Query Execution
#### Deferred Execution
The query execution is deferred until you iterate over the query variable in a *foreach* statement. The *foreach* statement is also where the query results are retrieved. Because the query variable itself never holds the query results, you can execute it as often as you would like. 

An example to demonstrate *deffered execution* follows:

```
//  Query execution.
foreach (int num in numQuery)
{
    Console.Write("{0,1} ", num);
}
```

#### Immediate Execution
To force immediate execution of any query and store its results, you can call the *ToList* or *ToArray* methods:

```
List<int> numQuery2 =
    (from num in numbers
     where (num % 2) == 0
     select num).ToList();

// or like this:
// numQuery3 is still an int[]

var numQuery3 =
    (from num in numbers
     where (num % 2) == 0
     select num).ToArray();
```

 You can also force execution by putting the *foreach loop* immediately after the query expression. However, by calling *ToList* or *ToArray* you also store all the data in a single collection object.
