# Hooks API
- Address the question "would React be simpler if there was just one common way to reuse code?"
- Are ideal for sharing non-visual logic
- Let you use React state from a function
- Are reusable
- Apply explicit data flow inside of a component, not simply between the
- Don't introduce unnecessary nesting
- Don't suffer the flaws of Mixins
    - Mixins introduce implicit dependencies
    - Mixins cause name clashes
    - Mixins cause snowballing complexity
- Embracing Hooks will ultimately reduce the number of concepts when writing React applications
- Hooks will let developers always use functions instead of switching between functions, classes, higher-order components, and render props
- Code using hooks tends to minify better than equivalent code using classes
 
#### Example:
![React function using Hook](https://github.com/mcbarnhart/reading-notes/blob/master/images/react-hooks1.png)
The code behaves exactly as it states. The window width is used within the function.
![Custom React hook](https://github.com/mcbarnhart/reading-notes/blob/master/images/react-hooks%202.png)
The *React local state* supplies the information for the hook. Then a *side effect* would be used to set the state when the window resizes.
