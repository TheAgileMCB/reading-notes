# TREES!
A *tree* is an abstract data type that simulates a hierarchical inverted tree tree-like structure. It has a root value and subtrees of children represented by linked nodes.

## Terms
- **Node** - A node is the individual item/data that makes up the data structure
- **Root** - The root is the first/top *Node* in the tree
- **Left Child** - The node that is positioned to the left of a root or node
- **Right Child** - The node that is positioned to the right of a root or node
- **Edge** - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node
- **Leaf** - A leaf is a node that does not contain any children
- **Height** - The height of a tree is determined by the number of edges from the root to the bottommost node

## Traversals
### Depth First
In a *depth first* traversal, we prioritize going through the height of the tree first. There are multiple ways to carry out this traversal, and each changes the order in which the dataset is traversed and returned. Following are three methods for a depth first traversal:

- *Pre-order*, which traverses root -> left -> right or A, B, D, E, C, F
- *In-order*, which traverses left -> root -> right or D, B, E, A, F, C
- *Post-order*, which traverses left -> right -> root or D, E, B, F, C, A

The most common way to perform this kind of traversal is through **recursion**. We rely on the *call stack* to navigate back up the tree when we have reached the left-most leaf.

#### Pre-order Breakdown
```
ALGORITHM preOrder(root)

  OUTPUT <-- root.value

  if root.left is not NULL
      preOrder(root.left)

  if root.right is not NULL
      preOrder(root.right)
```

Pre-order means that the root has to be examined first. *looking at* the root just means outputting it's value-- like Peek(). When we call preOrder for the first time, the root will be added to the call stack.

Next, we start reading our preOrder function's code from top to bottom. We will output the roo.value. Then, we check the left edge of our root. If there is a left edge, it will be sent to the preOrder method recursively. Then, we make a new function call where 'B' is our new root. This process continues until we reach a leaf node.

**Note: The program will look for both a *root.left* and a *root.right*. Both will return *null*, so it will end the execution of that method call. 'D' will pop off of the call stack and the root will be reassigned back to 'B'. This is the heart of recursion: when we complete a function call, we pop it off the stack and are able to continue execution through the previous function call.**

The code block will resume where it left off when 'B' was the root and look for root.right. 'E' will be the output. But, since 'E' is a leaf, it will complete the method code block, and pop 'E' off of the call stack and return to 'B'.

So, without any children left to 'B', it will pop off and the call stack will resume execution of 'A'. This process will repeat itself down the left side of the next branch, then the right, and so on!

### Breadth First
*breadth first* traversal iterates through the tree by going through each level of the tree node-by-node. Refering to the top image, the output of breadth first looks like A, B, C, D, E, F. Traditionally, breadth first traversals use a queue.

First, the root enters the queue. Once 'A' has been Enqueued, Dequeue it and Enqueue the left and right children. This way, 'B' becomes the new front and the process repeats: Dequeue 'B' and Enqueue its children, 'D' and 'E'. And again, Dequeue 'C' and Enqueue it's children. This continues until there are no children left. Then each item is Dequeued in order until the queue is empty.

## Binary Tree
These examples have been *binary trees* Binary trees have at most two children per parent node-- *left* and *right*. There is no specific sorting to a binary tree. We can choose to add nodes wherever there is a free edge. 

## Binary Search Trees
*Binary Search Trees (BST) do have a structure applied to them. The root value is the value that exists in the middle of all other values in the dataset. Values that are lower and linked from the left and larger values are linked from the right.

Searching a BST can be done quickly-- we perform a binary search. We simply compare the node we are searching for against the root. If the root is larger we look left, if smaller, we look right, shifting the new root to the next value centered among the remaining values. This process repeats until the sought after value is identified.

The best way to perform this search is a *while loop*. And the Big O complexity is O(h) where h is the height of the tree. In a balanced or *perfect tree*, the height is log(n). The Big O space complexity would be O(1), because no additional space is allocated during a search.
