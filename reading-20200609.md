# Identity
Identity uses 3 classes to represent a user:
## Claims
A *Claim* represents a single fact about a user. *FirstName* is one kind of claim. *LastName* is another. Yet another might be *BirthDate*. Claims are their own class. Their most common constructor takes two parameters: a string *type* representing the name of the claim, and a string *value* representing the information about the user.
## ClaimsIdentity
The *ClaimsIdentity* class represents a form of identification of the user. It is like a driver's license or passport for ASP.NET. Instances of a *ClaimsIdentity* can be authenticated.
## ClaimsPrincipal
The *ClaimsPrincipal* class represents the actual user. It can contain one or more instances of the *ClaimsIdentity* class, which in turn can contain one or more instances of the *Claim* class. The *ClaimsPrincipal* is what the *HttpContext.SignInAsync* method accepts and passes to an *AuthenticationHandler*.
 
# Verbs
There are 5 *verbs* that are invoked by an authentication system. These commands work together to allow users to access different ranges of data.
- **Authenticate** - retrieves user's information if it exists
- **Challenge** - requests authentication by user
- **SignIn** - persists the user's information into some kind of storage
- **SignOut** - removes the user's persisted information
- **Forbid** - denies access to a resource for unauthenticated users
 
# Authentication Handlers
*Authentication Handlers* implement the 5 verbs listed above. ASP.NET's default handler is the Cookies authentication handler. This means that ASP.NET stores user data in cookies, which are small pieces of data stored by the user's web browser in their local environment. Authentication handlers must be registered with the authentication system.
 
Authentication handlers are associated with schemes, which are stings that identify unique authentication handles within a dictionary context. The default scheme for the Cookies authentication handler, for instance, is "Cookies", but it can be changed to anything. Authentication handles can be used in tandem, sharing their responsibilities with each other.
 
# Authentication Middleware
In short, a middleware is a module that can be inserted into the startup sequence and is run on every HTTP request. *Authentication middleware* checks if a user is authenticated on every request. On the request, the authentication middleware requests the default scheme authentication handler to run its authentication code. Then, the authentication handler returns the information to the middleware, which then populates the HttpContext.User object with the returned information.
