# Graphs
1. A *graph* is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of ________ (or __________) potentially connected by line segments named ________.
2. The _________ of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e. are connected by an edge.
3. The __________ of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.
4. A(n) _____________ is a graph where each edge is bi-directional. This means that the graph does not move in any direction.
5. A(n) __________ is a form of connected graph.
6. A(n) __________ describes the situation where a node can be traversed through and potentially end up back at itself.
7. A(n) ____________ is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes.
8. A(n) _____________ is a graph where all of its vertices / nodes have at least one edge.
9. A(n) _____________ is a graph with cycles.
10. A(n) _____________ is represented through a 2-dimensional array. If there are *n* vertices, then it is an *n x n* Boolean type of this.
11. A(n) _____________ has direction. Each node is directed at another node with a specific requirement of what node should be referenced next.
12. A(n) _____________ is a collection of linked lists or an array that shows all of the other vertices that are connected.
13. A(n) _____________ is a graph where some vertices may not have edges.
14. A(n) _____________ is a directed graph without cycles.
15. A(n) _____________ is when there are very few connections, and a(n) ___________ is when there are many.
16. A(n) _____________ *pushes* to a *stack* and uses a loop to traverse the graph.
17. A(n) _____________ is a graph with numbers assigned to its edges. These particular numbers give this graph its name.
18. A(n) _____________ is much the same as it is when applied to a tree. It relies on *enqueuing* and *dequeuing* each node.
