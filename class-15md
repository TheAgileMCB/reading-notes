#The Perfect Team

Employers have been trying to maximize employee potential since the dawn of business. Countless studies have been performed to anaylze individual employee workhabbits and attittudes to find the key. But what about groups? A *Harvard Business Review* study from 2016 found that "the time spent by managers and employees in collaborative activities has ballooned by 50 percent or more" over the last twenty years and, in many companies, more than 75% of an employees workday is spent communicating with coworkers. 

Collaboration. In software, engineers are encouraged to work together becuse studies have shown that groups tend to innovate faster, catch and correct mistakes more quickly, and find better solutions to problems than individuals alone. Also, people who work in teams tend to achieve better professional resutls and report higher job satisfaction. Teams are now a fundamental building block of companies, agencies, and organizations alike.

So it's no surprise that in 2011 Google set out to study the "perfect team." **Google** has rapdily become one of the biggest tech companies in the world. They now boast 114,000 employees and 66 billion dollars in annual revenue. Their most precious commodity? Information.

Through long years, probably millions of pieces of data, and many iterations Google's researchers thought they hit gold. The quality that they discovered as being paramount to good team dynamic is a quality called **psychological safety**. Psychological safety is loosely defined as a "shared beleif held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking." In other words, it arises when team members feel free to express themeselves without fear of rebuke or criticism. This allows the teams collective inteligence, creativity, and comfortability to flourish.

But how do you build psychological safety? Can data tell you? A Google team leader, Matt Sakaguchi didn't necessarily have the data, but he had a feeling. And that feeling was that through trying to connect to his team on a personal level, he could build a team that was less "business" and more "family" and, therefore, better suited to share in work together. one Engineer on Sakaguchi's team, Sean Laurent said "I think, until the off-site, I had separated things in my head into work life and life life. But the thing is, my work is my life. I spend the majority of my time working. Most of my friends I know through work. If I can’t be open and honest at work, then I’m not really living, am I?"

What Google's researchers discovered is quite profound, and simultaneously not at all surprising: 

>"people within Google is that no one wants to put on a ‘‘work face’’ when they get to the office. No one wants to leave part of their personality and inner life at home. But to be fully present at work, to feel ‘‘psychologically safe,’’ we must know that we can be free enough, sometimes, to share the things that scare us without fear of recriminations. We must be able to talk about what is messy or sad, to have hard conversations with colleagues who are driving us crazy. We can’t be focused just on efficiency. Rather, when we start the morning by collaborating with a team of engineers and then send emails to our marketing colleagues and then jump on a conference call, we want to know that those people really hear us. We want to know that work is more than just labor."
