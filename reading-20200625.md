# Login and Authorization
In the world where information exists at our fingertips, some organizations must be thoughtful about who can access certain information and how easy it is. That's where concepts *Authorization* and *Role-Base Access Control* come in.
 
**What problems do we need to solve for?**
- Is this a valid user (are they logged in)?
- What is the user authorized to do?
    - Which parts of our application care about this?
    - How can we determine this?
        -Whatâ€™s in the token?
        -Contact between the UI and the API
-How do we make this easy to use?
 
## Role-Base Access Control (RBAC)
Not all network tasks should be accessible to all users since every user's role is unique. Some users are high-level admins who need access to every aspect of a system. Some are specialized users who need access to particular segments of a network to perform specialized tasks. And others are mere visitors, who don't require authentication to operate within a system.
 
### Authorization vs. authentication
*Authorization* is a process in which developers control the access to information by users and also limit the actions users can perform.
 
*Authentication* is the process of identifying a user through some sort of credential system. It doesn't deal with access control, merely identity verification.
 
## Auth0
*Auth0* is a popular, versatile, and highly-trusted authentication system. Auth0 uses *rules* to assign roles to users.
>> "Rules are functions written in JavaScript that are executed when a user authenticates to your application. They run once the authentication process is complete, and you can use them to customize and extend Auth0's capabilities." - Auth0 Rules
A sample Auth0 rule and explanation:
```
npm install auth0-js
```
```
function (user, context, callback) {
  user.app_metadata = user.app_metadata || {};
 
  if (user.email === 'your-email-id@gmail.com') {
    user.app_metadata.role = 'admin';
  } else {
    user.app_metadata.role = 'writer';
  }
 
  auth0.users.updateAppMetadata(user.user_id, user.app_metadata)
    .then(() => {
      context.idToken['https://rbac-tutorial-app/role'] = user.app_metadata.role;
      callback(null, user, context);
    })
    .catch((err) => {
      callback(err);
    });
}
```
>> The code here is quite easy to understand. First, it is checking if the user that is authenticating has your-email-id@gmail.com as their email address (you will have to change this to your own email) and, if they do, it is setting admin as their role (app_metadata.role). If they don't, this code is configuring them as writers (app_metadata.role = 'writer').
 
>> After that, the code updates the user profile (updateAppMetadata) with the new information and ends up setting the role as a custom claim to the https://rbac-tutorial-app/role namespace of the ID token that Auth0 returns. Having that in mind, you can click on the save button to make your rule active.
 
You'll also need to configure Auth0 within your React project in a new file called *auth0-variables.js*:
```
export const AUTH_CONFIG = {
  domain: "<YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN>",
  roleUrl: "https://rbac-tutorial-app/role",
  clientId: "<YOUR_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID>",
  callbackUrl: "http://localhost:3000/callback"
};
```
And then create an *authorization context* file:
```
import { createContext } from "react";
 
const authContext = createContext({
  authenticated: false, // to check if authenticated or not
  user: {}, // store all the user details
  accessToken: "", // accessToken of user for Auth0
  initiateLogin: () => {}, // to start the login process
  handleAuthentication: () => {}, // handle Auth0 login process
  logout: () => {} // logout the user
});
 
export const AuthProvider = authContext.Provider;
export const AuthConsumer = authContext.Consumer;
```
And an *authorization componenet*:
```
import React, {Component} from "react";
import auth0 from "auth0-js";
 
import {AUTH_CONFIG} from "../auth0-variables";
import {AuthProvider} from "../authContext";
 
const auth = new auth0.WebAuth({
  domain: AUTH_CONFIG.domain,
  clientID: AUTH_CONFIG.clientId,
  redirectUri: AUTH_CONFIG.callbackUrl,
  audience: `https://${AUTH_CONFIG.domain}/userinfo`,
  responseType: "token id_token"
});
 
class Auth extends Component {
  state = {
    authenticated: false,
    user: {
      role: "visitor"
    },
    accessToken: ""
  };
 
  initiateLogin = () => {
  };
 
  logout = () => {
  };
 
  handleAuthentication = () => {
  };
 
  setSession(authResult) {
  }
 
  render() {
    const authProviderValue = {
      ...this.state,
      initiateLogin: this.initiateLogin,
      handleAuthentication: this.handleAuthentication,
      logout: this.logout
    };
    return (
      <AuthProvider value={authProviderValue}>
        {this.props.children}
      </AuthProvider>
    );
  }
}
 
export default Auth;
```
Herein, you store your data to sate and assign *AuthProvider* the state and methods you want to share with the authorization component's children.
Implement your login method:
```
initiateLogin = () => {
  auth.authorize();
};
```
And handle it:
```
handleAuthentication = () => {
  auth.parseHash((error, authResult) => {
    if (error) {
      console.log(error);
      console.log(`Error ${error.error} occured`);
      return;
    }
 
    this.setSession(authResult.idTokenPayload);
  });
};
```
And save the session to state:
```
setSession(data) {
  const user = {
    id: data.sub,
    email: data.email,
    role: data[AUTH_CONFIG.roleUrl]
  };
  this.setState({
    authenticated: true,
    accessToken: data.accessToken,
    user
  });
}
```
And logout!
```
logout = () => {
  this.setState({
    authenticated: false,
    user: {
      role: "visitor"
    },
    accessToken: ""
  });
};
```
