# Custom Hooks
- Allow for the reuse of stateful logic, but not *state itself*
- Can do the work of *higher-order components* and *render props*
- Each hook has a completely isolated state, so you can reuse the same hook twice in one component

## Hooks to Know
1. useArray hook
- Array manipulation is what a dev goes through every weekday. Adding elements to an array or removing an element at a given index is a daily routine for us. useArray reduces this burden by providing us with various array manipulation methods. This hook is a part of the react-hanger package.
2. react-use-form-state hook
- Forms are everywhere, even in the smallest of applications we have to encounter forms and manage their state. Managing form state in React can be a bit unwieldy sometimes.
react-use-form-state is a small React Hook that attempts to simplify managing form state, using the native form input elements you are familiar with.
3. react-fetch-hook
- Making ajax calls is like the most basic and most performed task for a frontend developer. And the React community is quick enough to create a hook for this purpose too.
4. react-useportal hook
- React Portals provide a first-class way to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component. And this hook helps us do that.
5. useMedia hook
- useMedia is a React sensor hook that tracks the state of a CSS media query. We all know the importance of the media queries and how much important is responsiveness for any site.
