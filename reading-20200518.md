# Model-View-Controler (MVC)
Model, View, and Controller are component groups that help applications achieve separation of concerns. The *Controller* receives user input, works with the *Model* to perform user requests or retrieve query results, and identifies the *View* to display to the user, utilizing data from the Model. The following dependency diagram illustrates this relationship:

The Controller depends on both the Model and the view, because it works with the model to process data and with the View generate displays. The View is dependent on the Model, because it displays data provided by the Model. But the Model depends on neither the View nor the Controller when it is processing and retrieving data. This is representative of the *separtion of concerns*. This way, the changes can be made to the View (in the way users see an app) or the Controller (in the way a user interacts with an app) without having an impact on the underlying logic of the app! This is particularly advantageous because the user experience tends to change more frequently than the underlying logic.

## Model
Microsoft outlines the Model's responsibilities as:

>represents the state of the application and any business logic or operations that should be performed by it. Business logic should be encapsulated in the model, along with any implementation logic for persisting the state of the application. Strongly-typed views typically use ViewModel types designed to contain the data to display on that view. The controller creates and populates these ViewModel instances from the model.

The Model is where all the computational power lies. It's the workhorse of your application. Functions and Classes are further separated here, but content that interacts directly with the user is excluded.

## View
Microsoft writes about the View's responsibilities:

>Views are responsible for presenting content through the user interface. They use the Razor view engine to embed .NET code in HTML markup. There should be minimal logic within views, and any logic in them should relate to presenting content. If you find the need to perform a great deal of logic in view files in order to display data from a complex model, consider using a View Component, ViewModel, or view template to simplify the view.

The View is where visual feedback is presented to the user. The view takes output from the Controller and the Model and gives it to the user.

## Controller
Then, about the Controller, Microsoft writes:

>Controllers are the components that handle user interaction, work with the model, and ultimately select a view to render. In an MVC application, the view only displays information; the controller handles and responds to user input and interaction. In the MVC pattern, the controller is the initial entry point, and is responsible for selecting which model types to work with and which view to render (hence its name - it controls how the app responds to a given request).

The Controller is how the user interacts with your application. The Controller is the middleman between the user and the View and Model groups.

## Notable Features of ASP.NET MVC
### Filters
*Filters* help developers encapsulate aspects of an application that are useful across different parts of the application. They create a place for pre- and post-prcoessing logic to live that keeps it separated from other bodies of logic, so as not to create need for repeated instances of the code or to force some parts of your application to depended uneccessarily on other parts.

### Dependency Injection
*Dependency Injection* allows controllers to request needed services through constructors. This allows those services to remain separate from the controller's logic in order to maintain the **Explicit Dependencies Principle**. The Explicit Dependecies Principle states, simply, "methods and classes should explicitly require any collaborating objects they need in order to function correctly." Your app can use *@inject* to utilize dependency injection.

### Testing
The use of dependency injection makes the framework easy to test, and Microsoft even includes features like TestHost and InMemory provider that make integration tests quick and easy, too.

### Razor new Engine
ASP.NET Core MVC views use the *Razor view engine* to render views. "Rzor is a compact, expressive and fluid template markup language for defining views using embedded C# code." Razor renders content dynamically on the server side and allows you to cleanly mix server-side code with client-side code:

```
<ul>
    @for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        <li>List item @i</li>
    }
</ul>
```
