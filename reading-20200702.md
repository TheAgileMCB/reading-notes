*Open source* refers to software that people can modify and share freely, because the source code is accessible to the public. Open source has extended beyond the software realm to include most any opportunity for collaborative exchange. Open source software is so potentially powerful **because** of its collaborative nature. Many different ideas and abilities come together to make the whole greater than the sum of its parts. And this influence can come from all over the world! Another benefit of open source software is that is is typically free to encourage access and collaboration.

In contrast, *proprietary* or *closed source software* is software owned and managed by one individual or team. Such software usually comes with extensive licensing to ensure end users can't legally reverse engineer, manipulate, or mis-manage the source code.

In fact, much of the internet has been built on open source software, making its effects on our modern world profound! Some other benefits as highlighted by [opensource.com](https://opensource.com/) are:

- **Control.** Many people prefer open source software because they have more control over that kind of software. They can examine the code to make sure it's not doing anything they don't want it to do, and they can change parts of it they don't like. Users who aren't programmers also benefit from open source software, because they can use this software for any purpose they wishâ€”not merely the way someone else thinks they should.

- **Training.** Other people like open source software because it helps them become better programmers. Because open source code is publicly accessible, students can easily study it as they learn to make better software. Students can also share their work with others, inviting comment and critique, as they develop their skills. When people discover mistakes in programs' source code, they can share those mistakes with others to help them avoid making those same mistakes themselves.

- **Security.** Some people prefer open source software because they consider it more secure and stable than proprietary software. Because anyone can view and modify open source software, someone might spot and correct errors or omissions that a program's original authors might have missed. And because so many programmers can work on a piece of open source software without asking for permission from original authors, they can fix, update, and upgrade open source software more quickly than they can proprietary software.

- **Stability.** Many users prefer open source software to proprietary software for important, long-term projects. Because programmers publicly distribute the source code for open source software, users relying on that software for critical tasks can be sure their tools won't disappear or fall into disrepair if their original creators stop working on them. Additionally, open source software tends to both incorporate and operate according to open standards.

- **Community.** Open source software often inspires a community of users and developers to form around it. That's not unique to open source; many popular applications are the subject of meetups and user groups. But in the case of open source, the community isn't just a fanbase that buys in (emotionally or financially) to an elite user group; it's the people who produce, test, use, promote, and ultimately affect the software they love.
