# SOLID
*Single Responsibility Principle*

This is the idea that every method or class in your application should exactly one responsibility or *reason to change*. By doing this, we make the function easier to test. When a method tries to do too much it usally results in "Arrange" sections that are long, difficult to read, and hard to maintain. A test should only test one thing. This makes for more tests, but they're more granular, more specific, and you can more easily pinpoint where your code is going wrong.

*The Open/Close Principle*

This principle is closly related to encapsulation and inheritance. It states that a method or class should be "open for extension, but closed to modification." 

*The Liskov Substitution Principle*

*The Interface Segregation Principle*

*The Dependency Inversion Princple*
