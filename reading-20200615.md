# React
*React* defines itself as "a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called 'components'".

**React.createElement** - This is the function that builds an element to be rendered on the page. Takes in 3 arguments.
- name of the tag we want to create
- properties for the element, like styles
- any children, such as another tag or text to display

## Components
A component is a JavaScript class or function that optionally accepts inputs, known as *props* or *properties* and returns a React element that describes how a section of the UI should appear.

## Props
*Props* s an object in React that contains properties about the component. Props can display dynamic data within a component.

## JSX
- *JavaScript As XML (JSX)* is a language extension that allows you to write tags directly in JavaScript. IT looks very much like HTML.
- You can even add *IDs* and *classes* right into your JSX tags with the *id* nd *className* attributes, respectively.
- JSX will usually use self-closing tags.
- In order to insert numbers into JSX, you have to use *curly brace notation ({})* You can also pass functions to these JSX templates.

## Babel
*Babel* allows you to write code that might not work yet in a browser because it's a new syntax, or because it's not supported. Babel compiles your code to a format that is compatible with the browser. Babel takes JSX tags and turns them into createElement calls.
