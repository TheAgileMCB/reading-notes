## HTML&CSS Chapter 5

### Images

* If you are creating a site from scratch it is good practice to create a directory for all of the site's images  
* To add an image to a page use the **<img>** element, which is an **empty element**  
    * the *<img>* element requires a **src** attribute to link to the image URL  
    * an **alt** attribute is required to provide a text description of the image when it can't be seen  
    * you can also include a **title** attribute to provide additional information  
    * the **height** and **width** of an image can also be specified in HTML, though it is best practice to use CSS to style images

#### Placing an Image

* Examples of image placement:
    * Before the paragraph - the paragraph starts on a new line after the image  
    * Inside the paragraph - the first row of text aligns with the bottom of the image  
    * In the middle of the paragraph - the image is placed between the words of the paragraph that it appears in  

*Old code: the **align** attribute used to indicate how the other parts of a page should flow around an image. The attribute takes horizontal values of **left** or **right**, and vertical values of **top**, **middle**, or **bottom**.*  

#### Creating Images

1. Save images in the right format - typically *.jpg*, *.png*, or *.gif*  
2. Save images at the right size - save the image at the same size it will appear on the site  
3. Measure images in pixels - this is the sizing that will translate most directly to a computer screen
