[Changing color theme using context](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/01/introduction-react-context-api/)

What follows are excerpts from the linked article walking through using context and hooks to toggle the color theme of an application.

### CREATING YOUR CONTEXT API
We will create our theme context in our ThemeContext.js file.

To create a context, we use React.createContext which creates a context object. You can pass in anything as an argument to React.createContext. In this case, we are going to pass in a string which is the current theme mode. So now our current theme mode is the ‚Äúlight‚Äù theme mode.
```
import React from "react";

const ThemeContext = React.createContext("light");
export default ThemeContext;
```
To make this context available to all our React components, we have to use a Provider. What is a Provider? According to the React documentation, every context object comes with a Provider React component that allows consuming components to subscribe to context changes. It is the provider that allows the context to be consumed by other components. That said, let us create our provider.

Go to your App.js file. In order to create our provider, we have to import our ThemeContext.

Once the ThemeContext has been imported, we have to enclose the contents of our App component in ThemeContext.Provider tags and give the ThemeContext.Provider component a props called value which will contain the data we want to make available to our component tree.
```
function App() {
  const theme = "light";
  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value = {theme}>
      <div>
      </div>
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
}
```
So now the value of ‚Äúlight‚Äù is available to all our components (which we will write soon).

### Creating Our Theme File
Now, we will create our theme file that will contain the different color values for both our light and dark themes. Create a file in your /src folder called Colors.js.

In Colors.js, we will create an object called AppTheme. This object will contain the colors for our themes. Once you are done, export the AppTheme object like so:
```
const AppTheme = {
    light: {
        textColor: "#000",
        backgroundColor: "#fff"
    },
    dark: {
        textColor: "#fff",
        backgroundColor: "#333"
    }
}

export default AppTheme;
```
###ThemeToggler.jsx
(For now, we will just return an empty div.)
```
import React from "react";
import ThemeContext from "../Context/ThemeContext";

const themeTogglerStyle = {
    cursor: "pointer"
}
const ThemeToggler = () => {
        return(
            <div style = {themeTogglerStyle}>
            </div>
    );
}

export default ThemeToggler;
```
### CONSUMING CONTEXT WITH FUNCTIONAL COMPONENTS
Consuming context with functional components is easier and less tedious than doing so with class-based components. To consume context in a functional component, we will use a hook called useContext.

Here is what consuming our ThemeContext with a functional component would look like:
```
const Main = () => {
    const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
    const currentTheme = AppTheme[theme];
    return(
        <main style = {{
            padding: "1rem",
            backgroundColor: `${currentTheme.backgroundColor}`,
            color: `${currentTheme.textColor}`,
        
        }}>
            <h1>Heading 1</h1>
            <p>This is a paragraph</p>
            <button> This is a button</button>
        </main>
    );
}

export default Main;
```
As you can see, all we had to do was use our useContext hook with our ThemeContext passed in as an argument.

### Updating Our Theme With The ThemeToggler Component
Now we are going to work on our ThemeToggler component. We need to be able to switch between the light and dark themes. To do this, we are going to need to edit our ThemeContext.js. Our React.createContext will now take an object resembling the result of a useState hook as an argument.

const ThemeContext = React.createContext(["light", () => {}]);
Copy
We passed an array to the React.createContext function. The first element in the array is the current theme mode and the second element is the function that would be used to update the theme. As I said, this just resembles the result of a useState hook but it is not exactly the result of a useState hook.

Now we will edit our App.js file. We need to change the value passed to the provider to a useState hook. Now the value of our Theme Context is a useState hook whose default value is ‚Äúlight‚Äù.
```
function App() {
  const themeHook = useState("light");
  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value = {themeHook}>
      <div>
        <Header />
        <Main />
        
      </div>
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
}
```
### WRITING OUR ThemeToggler COMPONENT
Let us now actually write our ThemeToggler component:
```
import React,{useContext} from "react";
import ThemeContext from "../Context/ThemeContext";

const themeTogglerStyle = {
    cursor: "pointer"
}
const ThemeToggler = () => {
    const[themeMode, setThemeMode] = useContext(ThemeContext);
    return(
        <div style = {themeTogglerStyle} onClick = {() => {setThemeMode(themeMode === "light"? "dark": "light")}}>
            <span title = "switch theme">
                {themeMode === "light" ? "üåô" : "‚òÄÔ∏è"}
            </span>
        </div>
    );
}

export default ThemeToggler;
```
### EDITING OUR MainWithFunction COMPONENT
The MainWithFunction Component should be edited as the following:
```
import React, { useContext } from "react";
import ThemeContext from "../Context/ThemeContext";
import AppTheme from "../Colors";


const Main = () => {
    const theme = useContext(ThemeContext)[0];
    const currentTheme = AppTheme[theme];
    return(
        <main style = {{
            padding: "1rem",
            backgroundColor: `${currentTheme.backgroundColor}`,
            color: `${currentTheme.textColor}`,        
        }}>
            <h1>Heading 1</h1>
            <p>This is a paragraph</p>
            <button> This is a button</button>
        </main>
    );
}

export default Main;
```

From a design standpoint, I am immensely interested in how these hooks can make our applications more dynamic, more accessible, and all-around more interesting to interact with!
