# Authorization
## Claims-based Authorization
A claim is a name value pair that declares what an identity is, not what it can do. An identity can contain multiple claims with multiple values and multiple claims of the same type.
 
Claims checks are embedded against a controller or an action with a controller. They specify which claims a user must posses, and potentially the value those claims hold. Claims requirements are *policy based*, so the developer must build a register a policy expressing the claims requirements.
 
An example of a controller with multiple *Authorizations* against it:
```
[Authorize(Policy = "EmployeeOnly")]
public class SalaryController : Controller
{
    public ActionResult Payslip()
    {
    }
 
    [Authorize(Policy = "HumanResources")]
    public ActionResult UpdateSalary()
    {
    }
}
```
 
## Role-based Authorization
Identities can belong to one or more *roles*. An example of this would be the User **and** Administrator roles. Roles are accessed by the developer through the *IsInRole* method on the *ClaimsPrincipal* class.
 
Just as with *claims-based authorization checks*, *role-based checks* are declarative5. The developer embeds them within the code, against a controller or action within a controller. Specifying a role means a user must be a member of that role to access the associated resource.
 
Multiple roles can be specified by a comma separated list:
```
[Authorize(Roles = "HRManager,Finance")]
public class SalaryController : Controller
{
}
```
or individual declarations:
```
[Authorize(Roles = "PowerUser")]
[Authorize(Roles = "ControlPanelUser")]
public class ControlPanelController : Controller
{
}
```
 
### Policy based role checks
Role requirements can also be expressed with a new *Policy* syntax. A developer registers the policy in the *Startup.cs* file as part of the Authorization service configuration in the *ConfigureServices()* method. That syntax is as follows:
```
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddControllersWithViews();
    services.AddRazorPages();
 
    services.AddAuthorization(options =>
    {
        options.AddPolicy("RequireAdministratorRole",
             policy => policy.RequireRole("Administrator"));
    });
}
```
 
Policies are then applied using the *Policy* property on the *AuthorizeAttribute* attribute:
```
[Authorize(Policy = "RequireAdministratorRole")]
public IActionResult Shutdown()
{
    return View();
}
```
 
One can also specify multiple allowed roles through a comma separated list in the *RequireRole* method:
```
options.AddPolicy("ElevatedRights", policy =>
                  policy.RequireRole("Administrator", "PowerUser", "BackupAdministrator"));
```
 
And one uses 
```
.AddRoles<IdentityRole>()
```
To add a role to the Identity Framework.
