# Interview with a Schema

**Q:** What is a Schema?

**A:** A schema is the tables, column, relationships that make up a relational datbase.

**Q:** Why do we use them?

**A:** We use them to determine the relationship between different data elements and to impose a logical structure upon the data based on these relationships.

**Q:** What do they look like?

**A:** They look like a series of connected boxes injected with data that relates to one another. They look like this:

**Q:** What are the different types of Database Keys?

**A:** There are many different Database keys:
- *Candidate Key* - a key of a table which can be selected as a primary key of the table. A table can have multiple candidate keys, out of which one can be selected as a primary key.
- *Primary Key* -  a candidate key of the table selected to identify each record uniquely in table.
- *Unique Key* - is similar to primary key and does not allow duplicate values in the column. By default, it creates a *nonclustered index* on heap tables, and it can allow one null value in a column.
- *Alternate Keys* - is a candidate key, currently not selected as primary key of the table.
- *Composite Key* - is a group of two or more columns that identifies each row of a table uniquely. It can be a primary key or candidate key also.
- *Super Key* - is a set of columns on which all columns of the table are functionally dependent. It is a set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table. Super key may hold some additional columns which are not strictly required to uniquely identify each row.
- *Foreign Key* - is the primary key of one table inside of another table. Foreign key can have duplicate values in it and can also keep null values if column is defined to accept nulls.

**Q:** I guess you answered my next few questions already!

**A:** Ha-ha. I do have a tendency to get ahead of myself.

**Q:** That's alright! So, how are they different? When do you use 1 over the others?

**A:** I've already outlined what distinguishes each, so I suppose it relates to what your data looks like and how you're trying to identify it. Tables store *a lot* of data in them, so how do you fetch exactly what you're looking for and not a similar piece of data? Keys! Because our databases are relational, sometimes there will be the same information in differet tables, so different keys help us to access those different data using different conditions. For instance, *primary keys* can't take null data, so I couldn't use that in a column with a null. Or we'll want to use a *composite key* to identify tables with many similar dat columns to other tables so we can identify the perfect combination.

**Q:** What are Relationships in a relational database?

**A:** A relationship is a situation that exists between to relational tables, where one table has its primary key inside another tables as its foreign key. It links tables that might otherwise have disparate information.

**Q:** What is a 1:1 relationship?

**A:** It means that a row in one table can *only* relate to one row in the table to which it is related, and vice versa.

**Q:** What is a Many:Many relationship?

**A:** This refers to a relationship between tables where a parent row in one table contains *many* child rows in the table it relates to, and vice versa.

**Q:** How about a 1: Many or a Many:1?

**A:** This is when *one* row in a table can *potentially* reference severl child rows in another table.

**Q:** Thanks for your time! That was enlightening.

**A:** Any time. Always happy to help!
