# Hash Tables
A hash table is a data structure designed to optimize the sorting and searching of stored elements. IT stores key value pairs, much like *JSON* or our *Identity Claims* It sorts, stores, and searches by performing a standardized algorithm called a *hash function* on the piece of data being stored, then translates the data into a storable index (called a *hash code*) using the *%* (modulo) to find a remainder. The element is then sorted into an array where the index matches the remainder of the computation.
 
When searching, one can enter the value one seeks, the hash function will perform its calculations and return the index at which that item should have been stored. This way, instead of searching the whole dataset to find the element, the hash table gives one only a comparatively small subset of data to search. Optimizing the Big O time with a constant value of O(1)! It also takes constant time to insert and delete, since the hash function efficiently performs the heavy lifting.
