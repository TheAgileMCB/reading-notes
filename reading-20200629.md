# React Native
*React Native* is an open-source mobile application framework created by Facebook. It is used to develop applications for Android, iOS, Web and UWP by enabling developers to use React along with native platform capabilities.
## Function vs. Class Components
- originally, only class components could have state
- React Hooks API was introduced in version 0.58
- Hooks enable function components to access state
## Core Components
You use JavaScript to access your platform’s APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React components: bundles of reusable, nestable code.
### Views
 In Android and iOS development, a view is the basic building block of UI: a small rectangular element on the screen which can be used to display text, images, or respond to user input. Even the smallest visual elements of an app, like a line of text or a button, are kinds of views. Some kinds of views can contain other views. It’s views all the way down!

 ### Native Components
 In Android development, you write views in Kotlin or Java; in iOS development, you use Swift or Objective-C. With React Native, you can invoke these views with JavaScript using React components. At runtime, React Native creates the corresponding Android and iOS views for those components. Because React Native components are backed by the same views as Android and iOS, React Native apps look, feel, and perform like any other apps. We call these platform-backed components Native Components.

 # Xamarin
 Xamarin is an open-source platform for building modern and performant applications for iOS, Android, and Windows with .NET. Xamarin is an abstraction layer that manages communication of shared code with underlying platform code. Xamarin runs in a managed environment that provides conveniences such as memory allocation and garbage collection.
- Xamarin enables developers to share an average of 90% of their application across platforms
- Xamarin applications can be written on PC or Mac and compile into native application packages

 ## Xamarin.Android
 Xamarin.Android applications compile from C# into Intermediate Language (IL) which is then Just-in-Time (JIT) compiled to a native assembly when the application launches. Xamarin.Android applications run within the Mono execution environment, side by side with the Android Runtime (ART) virtual machine. Xamarin provides .NET bindings to the Android.* and Java.* namespaces. The Mono execution environment calls into these namespaces via Managed Callable Wrappers (MCW) and provides Android Callable Wrappers (ACW) to the ART, allowing both environments to invoke code in each other.

 ## Xamarin.iOS
 Xamarin.iOS applications are fully Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compiled from C# into native ARM assembly code. Xamarin uses Selectors to expose Objective-C to managed C# and Registrars to expose managed C# code to Objective-C. Selectors and Registrars collectively are called "bindings" and allow Objective-C and C# to communicate.

 ## Xamarin.Forms
- The pattern most often used for mobile app development is to develop twice. Once for Android and once for iOS
- *Xamarin.Forms* allows you to work in one integrated development environment, with one language 
- ou create your UI once, and both iOS and Android use that UI definition, including the actions and events you code

## Xamarin.Essentials
- *Xamarin.Essentials* handles many of the common needs of mobile apps that don't have to do with the UI
- downloadable NuGet package
- access to things like device GPS, accelerometer, and battery and network states
